I am **Khandaker Foysal Haque**, a Ph.D. candidate in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University**, affiliated with the pioneering [Mentis Lab](https://mentis.info/). My research focuses on advancing the frontiers of **intelligent wireless networking**, **integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)**, and **AI/ML-driven wireless systems**, with a particular emphasis on **MU-MIMO systems** and **edge computing**.

Under the mentorship of **Prof. Francesco Restuccia**, I strive to develop innovative solutions to critical challenges in next-generation wireless networks, leveraging cutting-edge techniques in machine learning, signal processing, and network optimization. My work has been recognized with the **Best Paper Award** at [IEEE iSES 2020]() and includes publications in prestigious venues such as **IEEE Communication Letters**, **Computer Networks**, **INFOCOM**, **MobiCom**, and others.
